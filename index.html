                 <h3>Change of My life</h3>

                <p> 
                

When my parents told me that my grandpa died,I thought they were lying. I kept telling them to stop lying like that. I finally realized from the way of their facial expressions that they were not lying.I could not believe what I was hearing,From that point on I did not know what to do or say.

     All I know is that I started crying loudly and breathing heavily. As I started running into my room my uncle was right behind me running after me and he told me that dying is a part of life and that my grandpa is in a better place. I stopped all the crying and started thinking about all the important lessons he helped me learn in life. When I was  from the ages 6-12 I always used to get bullied because I was alway younger than the other kid in my class. 

     They used to always try fight me or talk about me because they said I was ugly and that I dressed like a tomboy. They even had my brother who was in the same class with me bully me too.When they used to fight me, I never used to say anything back because I thought it was stupid for me to entertain them. Once my grandpa found out what was going on he told me to start standing up for myself he said I don't need to fight to make a point but he said if it comes to that I got to do what I got to do. Ever since then I never let anyone disrespect me. If I give you respect, I demand it back.

     When I was younger I used to alway see my grandpa being a caring loyal person.If his friends needed anything he would always be there for them. He even let a couple of his friends stay with him until they got themselves together. I have some cousins that are not even my blood relative but they been there since I was younger and my grandpa was taking care of me and them at same time. I learned so much from his death that made me the person I am today.
