    <h1>Spainsh</h1>
    <p>In spainsh I dedicated my altar to selena. I dedicated it to her because I loved her music and her personality. I also loved her style of clothing.Me and selena had alot in common like both of are favorite colors were purple and black. I feel like she would have a really good connecting to Dia De Los Muerto because she is mexican is this is apart of there tradition to celebrate the Day Of The Dead.I made a board with her favorite colors,flowers and foods. I also had some pictures her framed and I put them around the altar.</p>
